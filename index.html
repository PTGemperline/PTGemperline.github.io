  <h2>Thoughts on chapter dos</h2>
    <p>I belive I'm starting to see where this book is going. It is not a step by step how to, its a book of suggestions. And here are
      my thoughts on the some of the ones from chapter 2.</p>
    <p>They drilled hard into the idea that things should not be repeated. The idea is pretty clear, if you wrote it once it's more work to
      write it again. But more than that, if you wrote it once then it means you have to sections that do the same thing and that's gonna 
      cause complications downt he line. From recent experience I can verify that this is not easy. At least not when you are working with 
      a group of people, but in that case it is probably even more important.</p>
    <p>This seems to me to run right into their idea of orthogonality. Now I personally think of orthogonality in mathimatical principles 
      where the inner product of to orthogonal things is zero. But I belive its a novel analogy to softare engineering. The inner product
      is often refered to as a mapping of one thing onto another. So if code is orthogonal, then when you map it to other sections of code,
      it has not like components and thus is 0. So basically make code simple and self reliant as much as possible and your good.</p>

  <h2> What I found interesting in chapter 1</h2>
  <p> Not what I was expecting at all. When I envisioned a book about coding I expected lists of commands and shortucuts and things you 
    should do to make code easily integrable with other code. Not what it was. Instead the whole first chapter was very general and just 
    brushed over what it means to be a good programer. The section about your knowledge portfolio was interesting and made sense, but I'm
    still waiting for when the book is going to really focus on code. Although maybe I just mistunderstood what the purpose of it is.
    <br>
  <h2>What Software Engineering means to me</h2>
    <p> I really don't get how software engineering is any different to coding. As far as i can tell its the same thing but with alot of
      people and fancy programs to make it faster. According to a friend "its getting used to working with alot of people and combining
      your efforts into a large project. You have to learn how to use development environements and git to become a better coder." I'm not
      really sure but I'm looking forward to learning more about it.</p>
