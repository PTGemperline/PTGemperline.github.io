  <h2>What Software Engineering means to me</h2>
    <p> I really don't get how software engineering is any different to coding. As far as i can tell its the same thing but with alot of
      people and fancy programs to make it faster. According to a friend "its getting used to working with alot of people and combining
      your efforts into a large project. You have to learn how to use development environements and git to become a better coder." I'm not
      really sure but I'm looking forward to learning more about it.</p>

  <h2> What I found interesting in chapter 1</h2>
  <p> Not what I was expecting at all. When I envisioned a book about coding I expected lists of commands and shortucuts and things you 
    should do to make code easily integrable with other code. Not what it was. Instead the whole first chapter was very general and just 
    brushed over what it means to be a good programer. The section about your knowledge portfolio was interesting and made sense, but I'm
    still waiting for when the book is going to really focus on code. Although maybe I just mistunderstood what the purpose of it is.
